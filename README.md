# [Colmar Academy](https://estherwhite-yt.github.io/Colmar-Academy/)

### June 2020

This project was originally completed in June 2020 as part of the **Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages** skill path by CodeCademy.

### Please check out my more recent work by visiting [monacodelisa.com](https://monacodelisa.com) or [my GitHub](https://github.com/monacodelisa). 

Long after completing the project, I moved it to this repository under my GitHub organization dedicated to projects featured in my YouTube videos. This move enhances both management and visibility.

I have documented my workflow in the following videos:
